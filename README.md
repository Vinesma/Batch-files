# Batch it up

A random assortment of batch files that I use.

## File management

Used to copy/move episodes of anime to a flash drive. Also renames them using a python script if the file follows this format: 

[xx] Title - 01 [xx].mkv

Also works with .mp4

## Youtube scraper

Used to tell me if a new video from the Yogslive channel is from the Chilluminati or Dark Souls (WIP)
